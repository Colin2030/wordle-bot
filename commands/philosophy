    const text = `ðŸŽ“ *Wordle Scoring Philosophy*

Our scoring system rewards *reasoned deduction* over *blind luck*:

- ðŸŸ¨ Yellows = info gained: spot the letter, find its home.
- ðŸŸ© Greens = correct placement â€” but only rewarded once!
- ðŸŸ¨ âž¡ ðŸŸ© = bonus for repositioning smartly.
- ðŸŸ¥ All-gray lines = slight penalty for inefficient guesses.
- ðŸ§  Clean early solves with lots of greens are impressive â€” but lucky hits donâ€™t get extra points for being lucky.

The aim: reward thoughtful, skillful play, not just fast luck.
